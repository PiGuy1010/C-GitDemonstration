# C++GitDemonstration
This is a README file, which many github repositories have to explain how to use the code in the repository.

For example, if we make a game with all sorts of files for graphics and physics and backend code, we would want to tell a new user HEY, GO OVER TO THAT FILE CALLED main.cpp, THAT'S HOW YOU ACTUALLY RUN THE GAME.
